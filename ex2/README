I done as the instraction says.
Since exponent, barred and negated can use for any sub-class of mathTerm I chose
to implement it in the mathTerm class itself.

answer to question
######################
if I want to do integral, I will do it same as the SUM term.
a class that extend mathTerm and will have 4 parameters. the lower limit, the upper limit,
 the integrad and the difrantial
